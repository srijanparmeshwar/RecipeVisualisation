in a large mixing bowl , <stir:700:> together the flour , semolina and salt .
<stir:701:> in the dried yeast -LRB- or <crumble:702:> in the fresh yeast , whichever you are using -RRB- .
<make:703:> a well in the centre of the flour mixture .
<pour:704:> most of the water into the well along with the olive oil and <bring:705:> the dough together with your hands or a wooden spoon .
as the flour is incorporated the dough will <start:706:> to take shape .
<add:707:> the remaining water if the dough feels tight or hard .
<turn:708:> the dough out onto a clean surface and <knead:709:> for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic .
<cut:710:> off a small piece of the dough and <stretch:711:> part of it as thinly as you can .
if you can <see:712:> the shadow of your fingers through the dough - the light should <shine:713:> through the dough like a window pane - without the dough tearing , it is ready to prove .
<knead:714:> the cut piece back into the dough and <shape:715:> the dough into an even ball .
<place:716:> in an oiled bowl , <cover:717:> with a damp tea towel and <allow:718:> to <prove:719:> in a warm <place:720:> for about 1-1 .5 hours , or until it has doubled in size -LRB- the temperature of your kitchen can <affect:721:> the timing of this -RRB- .
when the dough has risen , <take:722:> it out of the bowl and <knock:723:> the air out .
<divide:724:> the dough into two equal portions , and <shape:725:> each portion into a ball .
<cover:726:> the dough with a damp cloth and <allow:727:> to <prove:728:> again for about 15 minutes .
<place:729:> a pizza stone or an upturned baking tray into the oven and <preheat:730:> to its highest setting .

<turn:747:> out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and <knead:748:> it thoroughly for 8-10 minutes , or until the dough has become smooth and springy to the touch and is no longer sticky .
<use:749:> a floured finger to <make:750:> an indent in the surface of the dough ; it should <spring:751:> back when the dough is ready .
<dust:752:> the work surface again with a little more flour , then roll out the pizza dough , <moving:753:> it around on the work surface as you roll to <keep:754:> the shape circular and <prevent:755:> the dough from sticking , until you have a large , thin disc .
<press:756:> your <fingertips:757:> down into the dough all over the pizza base .
this <prevents:758:> it from <rising:759:> too much during cooking .
for the topping , <spread:760:> the passata over the pizza base , <leaving:761:> a 2cm/1in gap around the edge .
<season:762:> , to <taste:763:> , with salt and freshly ground black pepper .
