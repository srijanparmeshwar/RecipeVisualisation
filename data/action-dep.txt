<Leave:454:> to <cool:455:> for 10 minutes in the tin before turning out onto a wire rack to <cool:456:> completely .
For the ginger biscuit tombstones , <place:457:> the flour , ginger and bicarbonate of soda into a mixing bowl .
<Rub:458:> the butter in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs .
<Add:459:> the sugar , syrup and egg and <mix:460:> together until it forms a soft dough .
<Wrap:461:> in cling film and <chill:462:> in the fridge for 30 minutes .
<Pre-heat:463:> the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4 .
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and <cut:464:> out your shapes -- you will only <need:465:> a few for the cake so cut out some other Halloween shapes for extra biscuits .
<Place:466:> the shapes on to greased baking sheets and <bake:467:> in the oven for 10-12 minutes .
<Remove:468:> from the sheets with a palette knife and <place:469:> onto a wire rack to <cool:470:> completely before decorating with white icing .

<Blend:475:> the Oreo or bourbon biscuits to fine crumbs in a food processor .
<Spread:476:> the buttercream over the cooled cake , <covering:477:> the top and sides -- do n't <worry:478:> if it 's not smooth - a few lumps and bumps will make it more mud-like .
<Break:479:> the chocolate sticks in half unevenly , then <stick:480:> around the sides of the cake to <form:481:> the fence .
<Sprinkle:482:> the biscuit soil over the surface before sticking in the tombstones and <decorating:483:> with spooky sweets .

<Remove:525:> the pan from the heat .
While the syrup is boiling , in a large bowl <whisk:526:> the egg whites with a hand-held mixer until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed .
Then , with the mixer on a low speed , <pour:527:> in the sugar syrup in a thin steady stream - be careful not to <pour:528:> the syrup onto the beaters as it may splash onto your hands .
Once all the syrup has been added increase the speed of the mixer and <mix:529:> for about 10 minutes until the icing is completely cool , <thick:530:> and glossy .
<Do:531:> not <skimp:532:> on the whipping or your icing will be too soft and your ghosts will sag .
<Place:533:> the icing into a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle .
<Pipe:534:> a circle of icing onto each cupcake .
Then , <holding:535:> the bag upright over the centre of the cake , <pipe:536:> a tall mound of icing , then quickly <pull:537:> the tip away to form a small peak on the top .
<Add:538:> chocolate sugar strands for eyes or any decoration you fancy .
The meringue icing will <keep:539:> out of the fridge -LRB- the sugar syrup will have pasteurised the egg white -RRB- , but <make:540:> sure they do n't get too hot or the meringue will melt .

<Serve:656:> with the platter of fruit .
------------------
<Preheat:657:> the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7 .
<Line:658:> a baking tray with baking parchment .
<Rub:659:> the flour and <butter:660:> together in a bowl using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs .
Gradually <stir:661:> in the milk using a fork , <pulling:662:> the dry ingredients into the milk until the mixture comes together as a dough -LRB- you may not <need:663:> all of the milk -RRB- .
<Shape:664:> the dough into a ball .
Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface to <create:665:> a round pizza base , then <transfer:666:> the pizza base to the prepared baking tray .
<Spread:667:> the chopped tomatoes onto the pizza base .
<Sprinkle:668:> over the rosemary leaves and <season:669:> with freshly ground black pepper .
<Dot:670:> the pizza with the grapes , then <sprinkle:671:> over the grated cheese .
<Bake:672:> the pizza in the oven for 10 -- 15 minutes , or until the cheese has melted and the dough has crisped up .
<Serve:673:> with salad .
------------------
<Preheat:674:> the oven to 170C/190C fan/350F/Gas 4 .
<Line:675:> a baking tray with baking parchment and lightly <grease:676:> with butter , ghee or coconut oil .
<Grate:677:> the cauliflower into rice-sized pieces using a hand grater or food processor .
<Put:678:> all the pizza base ingredients in a bowl and <mix:679:> well with a spoon , or <add:680:> to the food processor and <blend:681:> , to form a sticky dough .
<Using:682:> the back of a spoon , <spread:683:> the dough out onto the greased parchment on the tray , <shaping:684:> it into a circle 30cm/12in wide .
<Bake:685:> in the oven for about five minutes , then <flip:686:> it over and <return:687:> to the oven for another two minutes .
<Pull:688:> the mozzarella ball apart into small pieces and <arrange:689:> over the base of the pizza .

<Sprinkle:694:> the basil over the top of the pizza before serving and drizzle with olive oil .
------------------
In a large mixing bowl , <stir:695:> together the flour , semolina and salt .
<Stir:696:> in the dried yeast -LRB- or <crumble:697:> in the fresh yeast , whichever you are using -RRB- .
<Make:698:> a well in the centre of the flour mixture .
<Pour:699:> most of the water into the well along with the olive oil and <bring:700:> the dough together with your hands or a wooden spoon .
As the flour is incorporated the dough will <start:701:> to take shape .
<Add:702:> the remaining water if the dough feels tight or hard .
<Turn:703:> the dough out onto a clean surface and <knead:704:> for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic .
<Cut:705:> off a small piece of the dough and stretch part of it as thinly as you can .
If you can <see:706:> the shadow of your fingers through the dough - the light should <shine:707:> through the dough like a window pane - without the dough tearing , it is ready to prove .
<Knead:708:> the cut piece back into the dough and <shape:709:> the dough into an even ball .
<Place:710:> in an oiled bowl , <cover:711:> with a damp tea towel and <allow:712:> to prove in a warm <place:713:> for about 1-1 .5 hours , or until it has doubled in size -LRB- the temperature of your kitchen can <affect:714:> the timing of this -RRB- .
When the dough has risen , <take:715:> it out of the bowl and <knock:716:> the air out .
<Divide:717:> the dough into two equal portions , and <shape:718:> each portion into a ball .
<Cover:719:> the dough with a damp cloth and <allow:720:> to <prove:721:> again for about 15 minutes .
<Place:722:> a pizza stone or an upturned baking tray into the oven and <preheat:723:> to its highest setting .
<Dust:724:> the work surface liberally with semolina .
<Roll:725:> out one piece of the dough to <form:726:> a circle that will fit on your pizza stone or baking tray .
<Transfer:727:> the pizza base onto a plastic chopping board -LRB- or another upturned baking tray -RRB- <dusted:728:> with semolina .
The tray will be used to <slide:729:> the pizza base directly onto the pizza stone .
<Cover:730:> the surface with half of the tomato sauce and toppings of your choice .
When ready to bake , <slide:731:> the pizza directly onto the pizza stone and <cook:732:> for 8-10 minutes , or until the base is golden-brown and the toppings are bubbling .
<Repeat:733:> with the remaining dough , tomato sauce and toppings .
------------------
<Preheat:734:> the oven to 240C/220 Fan/Gas 9 .
For the pizza dough , <place:735:> the flour , yeast and salt into a large mixing bowl and <stir:736:> to combine .
<Make:737:> a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and <pour:738:> in the warm water and oil .
<Mix:739:> the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients using first a wooden spoon , then your hands , until the mixture comes together as a soft ball of dough .
<Turn:740:> out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and <knead:741:> it thoroughly for 8-10 minutes , or until the dough has become smooth and springy to the touch and is no longer sticky .
<Use:742:> a floured finger to <make:743:> an indent in the surface of the dough ; it should spring back when the dough is ready .
<Dust:744:> the work surface again with a little more flour , then roll out the pizza dough , <moving:745:> it around on the work surface as you roll to <keep:746:> the shape circular and <prevent:747:> the dough from sticking , until you have a large , thin disc .
<Press:748:> your fingertips down into the dough all over the pizza base .
This <prevents:749:> it from <rising:750:> too much during cooking .
For the topping , <spread:751:> the passata over the pizza base , <leaving:752:> a 2cm/1in gap around the edge .
<Season:753:> , to <taste:754:> , with salt and freshly ground black pepper .
<Scatter:755:> over the roasted pepper slices , pepperoni slices and pieces of mozzarella .
<Bake:756:> the pizza in the oven for 10-15 mins , or until the base is crisp and <starting:757:> to <char:758:> around the edges .
Before serving , drizzle over a little olive oil , garnish with the basil sprigs , and <season:759:> again with a grinding of black pepper .
------------------
<Preheat:760:> the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3 .

------------------
For the pizza dough , <combine:769:> the flour , salt and yeast in a large bowl .
Gradually <add:770:> the water , <mixing:771:> well with your hands to <obtain:772:> a dough .
If you find the dough too <sticky:773:> , simply <add:774:> a little more flour .
<Shape:775:> into a ball , <cover:776:> with a cloth and <leave:777:> to <rest:778:> for five minutes .
<Knead:779:> the dough for about 10 minutes and <split:780:> it in half .
<Sprinkle:781:> some flour on a clean kitchen cloth and <place:782:> the pieces of dough on it .
<Cover:783:> with a slightly damp cloth and <leave:784:> to <rise:785:> for at least 30 minutes in a warm place .

<Cut:805:> off a small piece of the dough and stretch <part:806:> of it as thinly as you can .
If you can <see:807:> the shadow of your fingers through the dough - the light should <shine:808:> through the dough like a window pane - without the dough tearing , it is ready to prove .
<Shape:809:> the dough into a ball and <tip:810:> into a bowl .
<Cover:811:> with a damp tea towel and <leave:812:> to <rise:813:> for an hour .
<Divide:814:> the mix into three balls .
<Roll:815:> out on a floured surface into circles .
<Place:816:> each circle on a flat baking tray or a plastic chopping board dusted with semolina -LRB- so the pizza can be easily <transferred:817:> to the oven later -RRB- .
<Place:818:> a pizza stone or an upturned baking tray into the oven and <heat:819:> the oven to <220C/425F/Gas:820:> 7 -LRB- in a non-fan oven -RRB- .
